# Project 1 Documentation
## by Jerathel Jean

## Introduction
Hi folks, working on this project was quite the experience for me. At first I didn't know how to approach the project because I was uninspired. But after watching Alex's youtube channel, I felt inspired and ready to target the assignment.

# Project overview
Building a two player trivia game using HTML, CSS, JAVASCRIPT AND JQUERY. Storing all the trivia questions in contentful and using ajax call to retrieve the data through a url.

## Technologies Used
- HTML
- CSS
- JS
-JQUERY

## Challenges
I didn't have much problem coding up the game because Alex pretty much gave it all away in the playlist he gave us to watch. I struggled with getting player 2 to score every time player 1 goofs up. My biggest struggle was the responsive styling, I'm very new to it and I need to improve in that area.

My code looked like this
